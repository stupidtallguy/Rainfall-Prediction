A machine learning project focused on predicting daily rainfall in Sydney using the weatherAUS dataset. This report-driven implementation includes data cleaning, outlier detection, multivariate linear regression, probabilistic modeling (MLE), and regularization (Ridge regression). The project explores model robustness under noise and provides a real-world recommendation for rainfall prediction in climate-sensitive scenarios like flood alerts and irrigation planning. Developed as part of an AI course at Shiraz University, Spring 2025.
